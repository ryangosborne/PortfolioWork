# PHP Quotes Web App
This was my final assignment for INET 2005 which focused primarily on PHP. I received a mark of 97%, with a final course mark of 99%. 

The goal of the assignment is to develop and deploy a scaled-down social media web app using Laravel. We could choose the type of content shown on the web, and I chose mine to be famous and/inspirational quotes. 

The assignment required me to create a front-end that dynamically displays posts and several back-end admin portals for users with different permissions, such as user admin, moderator, etc. I integrated a MySQL database to store roles, users, posts, and their relationships. Users would be able to edit or delete their posts. Guests could register and make posts, as well. A user with the role of moderator was also able to delete or edit posts created by any user. An element of this was also to deploy the database in AWS and the web app to Heroku to be tested outside of a local environment.

My solution was developed over about three weeks, and on top of achieving the requirements above, I also gained experience working with Bootstrap, soft deleting, seeding tables, RESTful APIs, dynamically showing/hiding elements based on a user's role(s), data validation and security, password hashing, and a great understanding of MVC architecture. 

The final part of this was to enable a Theme Manager user to change the Bootstrap theme for the web app. While I was able to create, edit and delete themes, I was unable to implement the switching capability in the navbar before the assignment was due. 

This was a really fun project, even if I wasn't able to complete the last 2% of it. I really enjoy designing clean and intuitive interfaces for users and this was a chance for me to hone in on those skills.
