#Android Quiz Builder

This was an assignment I completed during Mobile Application Development (MOBI3002) in Fall 2021. I received a 100% for a mark on this assignment.

The goal of this assignment was to create a two- or three- screen Android application that asks the user to match a value to a corresponding question, like trivia. We could choose anything we wanted for the content and I decided on European countries and their capitol. My solution to the assignment required a strong understanding of lists in Java, file I/O, parsing text, error handling, OOP and Android App Bundles. Part of the assignment was to create a wireframe for the application and those files are located in the root project directory. 

About the program: A user will enter their name on the first screen, and then start the quiz. The first of ten questions will be presented to the user. A country name is presented with the instruction to choose the capitol for this country. Provided are four different buttons containing four different capitol cities in Europe. Of course one is the answer, and the others are answers for other questions in the quiz. Upon selecting an answer, the user will be shown if they were correct or not, and if not, which answer was correct. This process continues until all questions have been asked. The user will then be brought to a final results screen showing their overall score, with a button to start the application again.
