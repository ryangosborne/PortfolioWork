# Halifax Transit Tracker

This is an assignment I completed for my Client-Side Programming (PROG2700) class in February and March 2022. The solution involes JS, API usage, JSON filtering, geoJSON, Leaflet, and async programming.

The goal of this assignment was to display a map in the browser and represent the bus' geographic location on the map, with an image that rotates to the corresponding direction the bus is facing. The page also has to refresh every 8 seconds to show the updated movements of the bus. Solution also needed to incorporate pop-ups that provide information about the selected bus. 

The solution required me to format the JSON data return from the Halifax Transit API so it could be used in a GeoJSON format, which Leaflet uses.
