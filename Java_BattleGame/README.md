This Java-based battle sim game was co-developed with classmate Jessica Hooper during summer 2021. This was an assignment intended to be assigned in our Object-Oriented Programming course in Winter 2021 but was cut. We decided it would be a great idea to do the assignment throughout the summer, and we even expanded upon the original requirements. 

We were still very new to Java, OOP principles, and GUIs so this project reinforced a lot of those concepts and made us both more confident in our abilities.

Having recently used Java Swing in class, we chose to use it in our solution, along with a lot of OOP concepts like abstraction, inheritance, and encapsulation. We also used a custom font for the first time, developed functions for the game like shuffling a class' properties, and wrote an algorithm for determining the winner of a match based on the selected character and a randomly selected monster opponent. I even did some basic image editing to adjust the size of images. This was also the first time either of us had used GitHub in a collaborative setting which taught us how to effectively use it as a team. 

Looking back at this only seven months after completion, I see so many ways to improve the functionality and optimize the code, but I'm still really proud of this project. We both learned a lot throughout the development and kept our brains in programming mode over the summer break.
